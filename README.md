# Crystal Collector

Crystal Collector is a number guessing game that includes 4 crystals and a randomly generated target number. The value of the crystals is randomly generated with each round and is only known to the users once they are clicked on. That value will then be added to the user's guess total. If the user's guess equals the random target number then the user wins, if not the loser loses and the game resets. <br>
